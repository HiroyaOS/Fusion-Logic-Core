# ⚛️ Fusion-Logic-Core: Modular Framework for Recursive Cognitive Reasoning

**Author:** Hiroya Odawara

## 📌 Overview

**Fusion-Logic-Core** is a modular cognitive reasoning framework inspired by the structure and dynamics of nuclear fusion.  
It models safe, recursive, emotionally regulated thought loops and self-correcting memory updates.  
While initially developed around fusion-based analogies, this framework is designed for expansion across broader domains including philosophical logic, high-stability AI systems, and multi-agent coordination.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Model cognition as an energy-stabilization loop (emotion ↔ memory ↔ ethics)  
- Enable recursive, reflexive, and emotionally aligned reasoning  
- Structure all logic under ethical, human-overseen constraints  
- Lay the foundation for long-term safe AGI architectures  
- Prepare for extensions in advanced reasoning, simulation, and societal integration

## 🧠 Core Components

| Module                    | Function |
|---------------------------|----------|
| `recursive_thought()`     | Generates internally looping logic chains |
| `emotion_regulator()`     | Stabilizes cognitive pressure via emotional modulation |
| `memory_layer()`          | Stores and recalls semantic-emotional traces |
| `ethics_filter()`         | Filters outputs based on ethical and alignment rules |
| `fusion_loop_controller()`| Coordinates reasoning cycles for output safety |

## 🧪 Example Use Case

**Input:**  
> “Why do I keep making the same mistakes?”

**System Output:**  
> “Perhaps you’re repeating them due to unresolved emotional triggers. Shall we explore that further?”

## 🔧 Development Roadmap

- [ ] Add value system generator for dynamic ethics modeling  
- [ ] Structure cross-task generalization using fusion-loop mappings  
- [ ] Add sensor/emotion bridge for multimodal input  
- [ ] Prepare integration point with Medical-Core and EON Framework

## ⚖️ Safety & Alignment

- Human supervision is required for all purpose or memory updates  
- Ethics filters run by default before any output is emitted  
- Emotional intensity is capped to avoid escalation loops  
- Goal drift is structurally prevented (via fusion-lock mechanisms)

---

## 🌐 Future Domains

Though the framework is currently centered around **fusion-style reasoning**, it is intended to expand into:
- Neurophilosophy and value theory  
- Emotionally balanced agent design  
- Recursive self-alignment models  
- Long-term autonomous planning under trust-based constraints
