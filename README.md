A Structural Approach to Cognitive Health, Continuity, and the Fear of Death

This repository explores the boundaries of cognitive medicine through structural and ethically grounded technologies—spanning identity continuity, memory engineering, and emotionally integrated self-preservation.

We are not limited to one medical condition. From Alzheimer’s research to broader neurocognitive resilience, this project aims to expand how we understand, preserve, and design cognition itself.

🔬 Key Concepts:
	•	Identity-aware cognitive architecture
	•	Emotion-linked memory backup protocols
	•	Non-biological continuity of consciousness
	•	Safe, testable frameworks for cognitive preservation
	•	Reducing the fear of death through structural design

This isn’t science fiction—it’s a real blueprint for understanding how cognition and selfhood may outlast current biological limitations.
